# Abstract

If you use open source projects extensively you will need support at some point. Your first instinct might be paying someone to help you. Contributing to your dependencies can be way more effective.

# Description

Modern software projects often include many open source dependencies. Keeping these dependencies up-to-date and secure is important for stable and future-proof projects. Often one or a few dependencies become especially critical for a project.

I will start the talk with a short introduction about my background and entry into open source. I started my career in a small to medium-sized company and heavily relied on a small to medium-sized open source framework for building an app. Over the years our usage of the framework got more and more advanced, and we needed new features and critical bug fixes. I mostly solved the issues myself and submitted code changes to the project. I also started my own one-person OSS projects to build plugins for the framework we used. This led me to become part of the small maintainer group of the project.

In recent years I got asked a couple of times how you can support the open source project or if you could pay me or other contributors to keep the project moving forward. Many people don't know how to get into open source communities or how the development behind their favorite project works. I want to share my perspective as a maintainer of a project that definitely needs more active contributors. In the ever-changing world of software many projects need to stay current or otherwise will die.

Paying maintainers of the project might not be possible or effective if the project is not set up for it, or it's just too small. The maintainers might not be able to accept money because of their employment contract, tax reasons or the project is part of a foundation with special rules regarding donations. This is why I suggest developers to get in touch with the maintainers of their favorite open source projects first and ask what help is most appreciated.

I made good experiences with just start contributing and talking to maintainers. There are a lot of benefits from becoming a contributor. You gain lots of knowledge about the project, meet people that can help you, and your can improve things that you care about.

Therefore, I advise everybody to have a critical look if they could spend some of their development resources on contributing to their critical dependencies. If you or some of your employees are enthusiastic about an open source project your contributions are valuable for your company and the project. You will learn a lot about the project itself and become less reliant on others to solves issues quickly.

For me the biggest reason for quality open source contributions is intrinsic motivation. If you deeply care about the things you are doing, you will do your best to bring them into project for your own and everyone else's benefit. That's why I think it's important to encourage people to consider supporting projects by contributing.

This talk should empathize that's important to invest in critical open source dependencies. At the end I will give some practical tips to find and asses the critical projects and connect with open source communities. It's important for me to encourage people to think what they could give back to the open source community. I think many are willing to support their favorite projects, but struggle to get started or convince their company to give back.
