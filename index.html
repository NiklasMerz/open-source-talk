# Money doesn`t help much – Support projects with contributions

### Niklas Merz

# Agenda

0. Why this talk?
1. Facts about me
2. How many people get into Open Source
3. Getting invested
4. Advice for first time contributors
5. Onboarding new community members
6. Types of contributors
7. Is the project sustainable?

???

Roadmap for this talk
Structured like the typical journey of open source Contributors

---

# Why

* Critical look at every open source project you love
* Many projects have only a few maintainers
* Users and maintainers should be aware of the state of projects and *investments* made or required

???

* Open source software has been the foundation for all my day job and personal projects for years
* After some time you start to take a closer look at projects before you start consider using them 
* Many projects, also seemingly big ones could need some more maintainers
* What happens if one or two important people disappear?
* Is there a need to have a big investment in an older project

---

# Facts about me

1. Apache Cordova User
2. Minor Apache Cordova contributor
3. Active Committer & PMC
4. No longer Cordova app developer
5. I suck at CSS
6. This presentation is styled using CSS

???

* Give some context
* Framework for **building mobile apps using web technologies**
* **Previous job** introduced to developing apps this way
* I no longer work on apps but feel part of the Cordova project
* Fun fact CSS

---

# First contact

* Add an open source dependency to their project
* Discover a bug in an open source project
* Need a new feature

**What to do now?**

???

As promised the journey begins

---

# How people get invested

* Product is built on top of open source software
* Important pieces of their software, tooling or infrastructure stack is open source

-> **Issues arise that threaten their business**

* Sponsoring the core maintainers if possible
* Find someone to pay to do the work

-> **Think about doing the work themselves**

???

* Projects have security issues
* Project cannot keep up with external dependencies like OS updates think of iOS and Android
* Release cadence is slowing down and issues are not fixed in a timely manner

---

# Advice for first time contributors

* Be kind
* Be patient
* Read documentation: A lot of common questions should already be documented "somewhere"
* If in doubt, dont' be afraid to ask
* **You need to build up trust, reputation, merit**

???

This is a good time to stop and think about first time contributors

**When asked about getting into open source..**

---

# Support first timers as a maintainer

* Be kind
* Be patient
* Respond in a timely manner to keep motivation high and make contributions feel welcome

???

The other perspective

It's basically the same

---

# From first time to casual contributor

* Contributors see value in their work for the project
* They learn to navigate the waters

* Quality contributions
* Continued interest and participation

???

Turnover point to make first timers feel welcome and keep them around
Keep them as users or contributors

This is where PMCs think about making some making someone a commiter or PMC

---

## How to support here

* Make paid support options visible
  * Contributors working as freelancers
  * Consulting Companies
  * Make clear that donations to the ASF cannot be used for development work
* Good and easy to find documentation on how to contribute
* Avoid too many "uncommon" steps and prefer existing tooling

???

* PLC4X has a site with companies available for paid support
* Timecho supports companies using IoTDB

# ASF donations
* Targeted donation to our ASF project did not help much because we could not spend it for development
* Infrastructure, tools, software were already in place
* We purchased test devices in the end, **might not helped as much as the donor hoped**

---

# Onboarding new community members

* Check and tell them if their contribution is vaulable, maintainable and documented in line with the project
* Get a feel if a new contributor works in the "open source spirit"
  * Can be trusted to complete task from start to finish
  * Listens to feedback
  * Asks for reviews and feedback before doing something possibly breaking
* Show trust early
* Review work and give advice

???

**Getting to know a community can be just as hard as getting into the code**

Someone stepped up started talking to me in Slack

# Get to know the people to understand the state of the project


???

* Observe a project a while to get to know the actors and activity happening there over a longer
period of time
* If like or use a project -> subscribe to the important channels & pay attention


---

## Types of maintainers

???

* From my experience there are common types of maintainers
* Person can be more than one type
* Good to know what type of people are needed to run the project
* **Names are totally made up by me**

---

### Silent hero

* Stays in background
* Does a lot of coding work
* Thankless tasks:
  * Releases
  * Updates, refactorings
  * Documentation
  * ....
* Progress

???

From my experience this is the most important type of maintainer to keep a project alive

* Does not need attention
* Wants to work effectively and drive progress

---

### Helping hand

* Contact person for the community
* Answers a lot of user questions
* Issue triage and response

???

Very important for the outward perception of the project and gaining new users

---

### Advocate

* Voice of the projects
* Talks and promotions
* Website, Documentations etc.

???

**Some projects have**

---

### Founder/Legend

* Started the project or contributor since "the early days"
* Lots of deep knowledge
* Knows the history behind things
* Sometimes hard to reach because they may have moved on to other things

???

* May not be very active in the daily work anymore but available 
* Try to keep them around

---

**Sustainbility is a questions about the community behind the code**

???

It's more important to know the community than just producing code

Know who is important for the project

Consider if new contributors bring something valuable to the project

---

# Is the project sustainable?

* People available for fixes and security issues
* Decisions are made and not stalled
* Getting releases out (votes)
* Development getting stuck
* Maintainer burnout

???

**The big question before investing in a project**

* With some experience you get a feeling.
* Is it risky using this because it might go dead?
* Is it worth to invest in this project?

---

# Closing words

* Get to know the projects you love or need for your business
* Paid support options are in demand
* **Maintainers** please encourage contributions
* **Open source beginners** please just start contributing

???

Every project is different

Getting new maintainers in costs time but is a worthwile investment
