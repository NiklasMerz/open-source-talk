# Why

I encountered quite a few projects where the maintainer group is very small but dedicated. Having only a few people responsible for the well-being of a project is not sustainable as only one or two people becoming inactive could mean the death of the project.

Users and maintainers should be aware of the state of the project and take steps to encourage people invested in the project to contribute to the best of their abilities.

# Who am I

1. Apache Cordova User
2. Minor Apache Cordova contributor
3. Active Committer & PMC
4. No longer Cordova user and semi active maintainer

# How many people start

Just using an OSS project

> The hardest thing is to progress from here. Many developers I know never made a step further. Why is that?

# How many people get invested

* Project becomes critical for business
* Finding issues & reporting them
* Fixing issues & first PRs
* Writing extensions, plugins, features critical for business success

> How to support here

# Turnover point

* Do work themselves
* Find someone to pay to do the work
* Sponsoring the core maintainers if possible

## How to support here

* Make support options visible
    * Companies (PLC4X used to do that)
* Good and easy to find documentation on how to contribute
    * Avoid to many "uncommon" steps and prefer existing tooling
    * Try to be helpful and respond timely with first contributions to keep motivation high

# Becoming part of the community

## Types of maintainers

### Silent hero

* Stays in background
* Does a lot / most of the work
* Ungrateful tasks:
    * Releases
    * Updates, refactorings

### Helping hand

* Contact person for the community
* Very important for the outward perception of the project and gaining new fans
### Advocate

* Voice of the projects
* Talks and promotions
### Dinosaur

* Started the project or there since "the early days"
* Lot of deep knowledge
* Knows the history behind things
* Sometimes hard to reach because they may have moved on to other things

-> Try to keep them around
