# Why

I encountered quite a few projects where the maintainer group is very small but dedicated. Having only a few people responsible for the well-being of a project is not sustainable as only one or two people becoming inactive could mean the death of the project.

Users and maintainers should be aware of the state of the project and take steps to encourage people invested in the project to contribute to the best of their abilities.

# Who am I

1. Apache Cordova User
2. Minor Apache Cordova contributor
3. Active Committer & PMC
4. No longer Cordova user and semi active maintainer

# How many people start

Just using an OSS project

> The hardest thing is to progress from here. Many developers I know never made a step further. Why is that?

# How many people get invested

* Project becomes critical for business
* Finding issues & reporting them
* Fixing issues & first PRs
* Writing extensions, plugins, features critical for business success

## Advice for first-time contributors

* Be kind
* Be patient
* Read documentation: A lot of common questions should already be documented "somewhere"
* If in doubt to be afraid to ask

##  How to support here as a maintainer

* Be kind
* Be patient
* Respond in a timely manner to keep motivation high and make contributions feel welcome

# Turnover point

* Do work themselves
* Find someone to pay to do the work
* Sponsoring the core maintainers if possible at all

## How to support here

* Make paid support options visible
    * Companies (PLC4X used to do that)
    * Contributors working as freelancers
    * **Donations to the ASF cannot be used for development work**
* Good and easy to find documentation on how to contribute
    * Avoid to many "uncommon" steps and prefer existing tooling

# Becoming part of the community

* Get a feel if a new contributor works in the "open source spirit"
    * Can be trusted to complete task from start to finish
    * Listens to feedback
    * Asks for reviews and feedback before doing something possibly breaking
* Show trust early
* Review work and give advice
## Types of maintainers

### Silent hero

* Stays in background
* Does a lot / most of the work
* Ungrateful tasks:
    * Releases
    * Updates, refactorings

### Helping hand

* Contact person for the community
* Very important for the outward perception of the project and gaining new fans
### Advocate

* Voice of the projects
* Talks and promotions
* Website, Documentations etc.
### Dinosaur

* Started the project or there since "the early days"
* Lot of deep knowledge
* Knows the history behind things
* Sometimes hard to reach because they may have moved on to other things

> Try to keep them around
