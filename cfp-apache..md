# Title

Don't throw money at us, support the project with people

# Abstract / Description

In recent years I got asked a couple of times how you can support the Apache Cordova project or if you could pay me or other contributors to keep the project moving forward. Many people don't know how to get into open source communities or how the development behind their favorite project works. I want to share my perspective as a maintainer of a project that definitely needs more active contributors. In the ever-changing world of software many projects need to stay current or otherwise will die.

Paying the Apache Software Foundation for development work is not possible. Money donated to the foundation is used to run the foundation and infrastructure. Targeted donations can be used for projects needs like special software or hardware, but not paid hours of developers working on the project.

Therefore, I advise everybody to have a critical look if they could spend some of their development resources on contributing to their critical dependencies. If you or some of your employees are enthusiastic about an open source project your contributions are valuable for your company and the project. You will learn a lot about the project itself and become less reliant on others to solves issues quickly.

For me the biggest reason for quality open source contributions is intrinsic motivation. If you deeply care about the things you are doing, you will do your best to bring them into project for your own and everyone else's benefit. That's why I think it's important to encourage people to consider supporting projects by contributing.

This talk should empathize that it's important to invest in your open source dependencies. At the end I will give some practical tips to find and asses the critical projects and connect with open source communities. It's important for me to encourage people to think what they could give back to the open source community. I think many are willing to support their favorite projects, but struggle to get started.
