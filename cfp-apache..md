# Title

Money doesn't help much - Support projects with contributions

# Abstract / Description

In recent years I got asked a couple of times how you can support the Apache Cordova project or if you could pay contributors to do development work. Many people don't know how to get into open source communities or how the development behind their favorite project works. I want to share my perspective as a maintainer of a project that could need more active contributors. In the ever-changing world of software projects need to stay up to date or otherwise will slowly die.

Just spending money is not always helping projects. Therefore, I advise everybody to have a critical look if they could spend some of their development resources on contributing to their critical dependencies. If you or some of your employees are enthusiastic about an open source project, your contributions are valuable for your company and the project. You will learn a lot about the project and become less reliant on others to solves issues quickly as well.

This talk should empathize that it's important to invest in your open source dependencies. At the end I will give some practical tips to find and asses the critical projects and connect with open source communities. It's important for me to encourage people and companies to think what they could give back to the open source community. I think many are willing to support their favorite projects, but struggle to get started.
